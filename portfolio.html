                        <h2>Project 1 - Top Down Driving Game</h2>
                        <p>
                            I developed a top-down driving game for my A-Level Computer Science coursework. Within a limited timeframe, 
                            I focussed on implementing core gameplay mechanics, including vehicle movement with lane changing, 
                            AI traffic that spawned ahead of the player with variable speeds and random lane changes, collision detection with a vehicle health system, 
                            and power-ups to make the game more engaging. The project involved designing and implementing the game's logic using Unity to manage user input, 
                            sprites and physics, and C# to create scripts to control the games behaviour. Throughout the project, 
                            I improved my problem-solving skills, gained experience working within a development timeframe while documenting the process, and gained a stronger understanding of game development as a whole.

                        <h2>Project 2 - RAW Photo Culling Script</h2>
                        <p>This project was aimed to solve a problem that I came across during my photography work. 
                            While culling images taken with my DSLR camera, which captures images in two different file formats (RAW and JPEG), 
                            I found it time-consuming to manually identify and delete RAW files corresponding to unwant3d JPEGs. To solve this problem, 
                            I created a python script that allows me to specify the exact directory of the folder that I was culling, identify and count the number of JPEG and RAW files, 
                            and automatically move any RAW files that do not have an associated JPEG into a separate directory named "Temp RAW Files". 
                            This small automation helped to streamline my photography workflow and reduce the amount of time required to manage large photo collections and minimise the risk of accidently deleting important files.              
                            <br><br>
                            I found this project interesting as I explored new libraries and gained experience with file management in Python. 
                            I used libraries such as os, fnmatch, and shutil to navigate directories, find files by their extension, and move them between folders. 
                            The script compares RAW (.nef) files against their corresponding JPEG files and moves them into a temporary folder instead of deleting them straight away. 
                            Implementing this ensured that no important files were permanently lost, allowing me to delete the temporary folder when ready.

                        <h2>Project 3 - Monty Hall Problem</h2>
                        <p>During sixth form, I created a simulation of the Monty Hall problem to explore the counter intuitive probability behind the game show scenario. 
                            I modelled the rules of the problem in python, which repeatedly runs trials where the player either switches or stays with their initial choice. 
                            By simulating the experiment thousands of times, the projects results demonstrates that switching doors results in a higher probability of winning.</p>
